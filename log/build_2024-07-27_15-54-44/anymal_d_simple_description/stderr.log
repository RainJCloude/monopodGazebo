[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:7 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findplugin_lib.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "plugin_lib", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "plugin_lib" with
  any of the following names:

    plugin_libConfig.cmake
    plugin_lib-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "plugin_lib" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "plugin_lib_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "plugin_lib" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
